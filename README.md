# AI Web App using Python and Flask

This repository contains an AI-powered web application built with Python and Flask. The app demonstrates how to integrate machine learning models into a web interface, allowing users to interact with AI features directly from their browser.

## Features

- User-friendly web interface built with Flask
- Integration with AI/ML models for real-time predictions or analytics
- Modular code structure for easy extension and maintenance
- Example AI tasks (e.g. text generation, classification, or image processing)
- RESTful API endpoints for programmatic access

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- `pip` (Python package manager)
- (Optional) Virtual environment tool like `venv` or `virtualenv`

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/naeemAbdul-Aziz/ai-web-app-using-python-and-flask.git
   cd ai-web-app-using-python-and-flask
   ```

2. **(Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running the App

1. **Set environment variables (if needed):**
   ```bash
   export FLASK_APP=app.py
   export FLASK_ENV=development
   ```

2. **Start the Flask server:**
   ```bash
   flask run
   ```

3. **Access the app:**
   Open your browser and go to [http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000)

## Example Usage

- Upload a file or enter text into the web form
- Click the "Predict" or "Analyze" button
- View AI-generated results directly in the interface

## Customization

- To use your own model, place it in the `models/` directory and update the loading logic in `app.py`.
- Add new routes and templates to extend functionality.
